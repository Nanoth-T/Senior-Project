**Note what I'm gonna do in this version**

*last updated 9/1/2024*
1. ~~need to adjust the code to make it simpler and more readable~~
2. ~~use the length of onset detection instead of the length of the target~~
3. ~~remove EOS as it's unnecessary for this version~~
4. add logger
5. create overfitted model using one sample

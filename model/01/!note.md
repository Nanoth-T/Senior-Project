**Note what I'm gonna do in this version**

*8/1/2024*
1. need to adjust the code to make it simpler and more readable
2. use the length of onset detection instead of the length of the target
3. remove EOS as it's unnecessary for this version
4. add logger
5. create overfitted model using one sample
